As for some outdated content - this is a tech field that changes rapidly, so nothing surprising here, took me some documentation surfing for the updates but overall most of the content can be followed and replicated. The textual part of the course was less engaging I admit but this is life of a programmer I guess, handholding ends at some point. Thank you, Angela!",

However, to be clear, there are only 81 days of lessons, the last 19 are for projects where you are entirely on your own. Some days will take much longer than 1 calendar day to complete, particularly if you are working full time. The data science section is not explained well; this would be a great introduction for someone with prior data science experience wanting to learn how to do things in Python, but if you have no knowledge then the basics of data science itself are not taught. The first 30-40 days of the course have the most teaching/explanations, after that I strongly suggest looking through the comments for each lesson to learn updated ways of doing things when the course is outdated and for additional helpful tips.",

Author says it's made this way in order to make you practice what you've learned, well I would say she just needed to fill the space in order to have \"100 days\" in course title.

Looking back, starting this course was the best choice I made that year. Numerous times have I used the knowledge I gained from it for other project thus helping the my whole team out. It thought me what is possible which I think is the most important: knowing your programming possibilities and the approach to them. It teaches very important topics that are crutial for understanding how the programming-world functions. This course is cleary above all else that I have bought in this platform.",
